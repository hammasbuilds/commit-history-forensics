> ### 25/25 genuine repositories clean. 2/2 fabrications caught - including one that hides the timestamp tell.

Contribution-graph generators produce a year of green squares in minutes. This measures how
well they hide, using only **structural** properties of the history - timestamps,
uniformity, cadence - so the verdict holds regardless of what the code contains.

Nothing is trained. Every threshold sits in `src/score.py` beside its reasoning, so you can
disagree with a number rather than with a black box.

---

## The result

| | Repos | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|
| Genuine histories | **25** | **25 CLEAN** - zero false positives |
| Fabricated, naive | 1 | **FABRICATED** (4/5 signals) |
| Fabricated, committer date concealed | 1 | **FABRICATED** (3/5 signals) |

**The second fabrication is the one that matters.** Setting `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` defeats
the timestamp signal completely - and it is still caught, because it edits exactly one file
in every commit and real work does not.

| Repository | median author&rarr;committer gap | files per commit |
|---|---:|---:|
| `fake_naive` | **37 days** | **1.00** |
| `fake_hidden` | 0 days | **1.00** |
| control (genuine) | 0 days | 3.2 |
| 24 real repositories | 0 days | 1.0 - 95.6 |

&#128269; **[What each signal measures, and what defeats it &rarr;](docs/SIGNALS.md)**

---

## Why the detector and not the generator

This started from evaluating a contribution-graph generator. Using one is a bad trade: it
fabricates history, it is detectable by everything here, and **a single fabricated repo
makes a reviewer re-read all the genuine ones with suspicion.**

The interesting half - and the defensible one to publish - is measuring how visible the
fabrication is.

`src/synthesize.py` exists **only** to produce ground truth. It writes to a temporary
directory and pushes nowhere.

---

## Run it

```bash
python src/features.py   <folder-of-repos>   # raw fingerprints
python src/score.py      <folder-of-repos>   # verdicts
python src/synthesize.py <output-folder>     # build fakes to test against
pytest -q                                    # 13 tests
```

It reads `git log` live, so verdicts describe repositories as they are now.

**The tests build real git repositories** in `tmp_path` with real commits - no mocks, no
committed fixtures - so behaviour is checked against real git objects.

---

## Input

A folder of git repositories. Here, two fabricated histories and one honest control,
all built by `synthesize.py` so the ground truth is known.

![input](docs/images/input.png)

## Output

![output](docs/images/output.png)

*`fake_hidden` forges the committer date too, so `backdated_commits` never fires — it is
caught by `single_file_every_commit` instead. The honest control draws zero flags.*

---

## An honest limitation, asserted in the tests

An adversary who **both** conceals the committer date **and** keeps the history short
(under ~60 days, few commits per day) defeats three of five signals and reaches only
`SUSPICIOUS`.

`test_short_hidden_fake_is_only_suspicious` asserts exactly that, so the limitation cannot
quietly disappear or quietly get worse.
